# New-York-city-Trip-duration-prediction
To determine which route is the best one to take, we need to predict how long the trip will last when taking a specific route. Therefore, the goal of this playground competition is to predict the duration of each trip in the test data set, given the start and end coordinates.
In summary, the conclusions drawn from the provided paragraphs and charts are as follows:

Data Overview:

The dataset contains approximately 1.5 million records.

There are no NaN or duplicate records in the dataset, eliminating the need for data imputation.

Trip Duration Analysis:

Most trips have durations between 0.5 minutes and 2 hours.

The dataset has extreme values, with a minimum trip duration of 1 second and a maximum of 3,526,282 seconds, indicating the presence of outliers.

Outliers with very short or very long trip durations need further attention and possible removal.

Passenger Count Analysis:

The passenger count ranges from 0 to 9.

Trips with 0 passengers are considered outliers and should be removed.

The assumption is that taxis cannot carry more than 6 passengers.

Trips with passenger counts of 2 and 4 tend to have the highest mean trip durations.

Feature Engineering:

Suggested extracting information from the 'pickup_datetime' field, such as the hour of the day, day of the week, and day of the month, to account for traffic patterns and seasonality.

Geospatial Analysis:

Emphasizes the value in 'latitude' and 'longitude' variables for clustering locations into neighborhoods and calculating distances and directions between coordinates.

Column Removal:

Suggested removing columns 'Pickup_Year', 'id', 'pickup_datetime', and 'dropoff_datetime' due to redundancy or lack of relevance.

Outlier Observations:

Identified several outliers, including passenger count of 0, very short trips, very long trips, and trips with more than 6 passengers.

The plan is to further analyze and potentially remove these outliers.

Vendor Analysis:

Vendor 2 has the highest number of trips.

Store and Forward Flag Analysis:

Vendor 2 has no recorded trips with the 'Y' flag, suggesting they may not store and forward trips.

Monthly Analysis:

The highest number of trips occurs in the 3rd month, with relatively consistent trip counts across other months.

Day of the Week Analysis:

Trip counts are lower on Sundays and Mondays, while they are higher on Fridays and Saturdays, indicating differences related to weekdays and weekends.

Time of Day Analysis:

Trip counts increase significantly in the evening (6 pm to 10 pm) and decrease after midnight (1 am to 6 am).

The mean trip duration follows a distinct pattern throughout the day, peaking between 2 PM and 4 PM.

Distance Category Analysis:

Most trips are not above 30 kilometers, with a notable number of very short trips (e.g., 74,184 trips for half a kilometer).

Outlier Removal:

Suggests removing entries with passenger counts outside the range of 1 to 6 and trips below 1 minute or above 2 hours.

Vendor Comparison:

Vendor 2 has more trips compared to Vendor 1.

Store and Forward Flag Analysis:

Trips with the "Store and Fwd No" flag show the highest mean trip durations.

Monthly Trends:

May and June stand out with the highest mean trip durations, suggesting potential factors driving longer trips during these months.

Benefits of the insights:

Vendor performance assessment and resource allocation.

Improving data recording and service quality.

Resource planning for single-passenger trips.

Scheduling and resource allocation based on weekdays and weekends.

Preparation for seasonality and monthly demand fluctuations.

Efficient management during peak hours.

Negative Points or Considerations:

Investigate Vendor 1's performance and fairness.

Address unrecorded trip issues for data accuracy.

Understand the reasons behind single-passenger trips.

Explore the specific reasons behind monthly trends.

Investigate time-of-day trends and their drivers.

Data Splitting:

70% training data and 30% testing data to balance learning and evaluation.

Primary Independent Variable:

Distance has the most significant impact on trip duration, followed by time and, to a lesser extent, the day.

Algorithm Selection:

XG Boost is chosen as it has the least error, making it a suitable algorithm for the dataset.

These conclusions provide a foundation for further data preprocessing, feature engineering, and modeling to build a predictive model for trip duration. The insights gained from the dataset help in making informed decisions and optimizing the taxi service.
